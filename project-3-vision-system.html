              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                During my internship at AIT (Austrian Institute of Technology) in Vienna, I conducted an in-depth feasibility study 
                for integrating a vision system into WAAM (Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing) industrial machines. 
                WAAM is an advanced manufacturing technique that uses a welding arc to deposit metal wire layer-by-layer, 
                creating large, complex metal parts with minimal material waste.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The challenge was to determine whether real-time computer vision could effectively monitor and validate 
                the quality of the additive manufacturing process. The study required analyzing camera capabilities, 
                image processing algorithms, machine integration points, and the feasibility of real-time quality control 
                on a 5-axis industrial machine. And for the biggest part, path following algorithms with several constraints 
                were simulated and evaluated.
              </p>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The feasibility study encompassed several key areas:
              </p>
              <ul class="project-details__desc-para" style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem;">
                <li><strong>Path Following:</strong> Development of algorithms for camera path following from a fixed distance behind the torch</li>
                <li><strong>Torch Simulation:</strong> Simulation of the torch movements and their impact on the camera path</li>
                <li><strong>Image Acquisition:</strong> Analysis of camera placement, lighting conditions, and image quality requirements for WAAM monitoring</li>
                <li><strong>G-code Analysis:</strong> Investigation of machine commands to correlate vision data with machine states and positions</li>
                <li><strong>Quality Metrics:</strong> Definition and measurement of visual quality indicators for additive manufacturing processes</li>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Methodology</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>1. Literature Review & Baseline Research</strong><br/>
                I conducted comprehensive research on existing vision systems in additive manufacturing, 
                analyzing published studies on WAAM quality control and computer vision applications in industrial settings.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>2. Camera Degrees of Freedom</strong><br/>
                I evaluated different camera positions and orientations relative to the welding torch. I opted for a configuration 
                where the camera is mounted on a robotic arm trailing the torch at a fixed distance and with the capability to rotate
                the camera on itself, allowing optimal perpendicular orientation.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>3. G-code and Machine Command Analysis</strong><br/>
                I studied the machine's G-code output and control system to understand how to follow the coordinates to 
                keep the camera in the right place to follow the torch movements at a fixed distance.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>4. 3D Model Integration Study</strong><br/>
                Using Rhinoceros3D, I explored how 2D vision data could be processed to reconstruct 3D part geometry 
                and validate against original CAD models.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>5. Performance & Feasibility Assessment</strong><br/>
                I benchmarked computational requirements, identified bottlenecks, and evaluated whether real-time processing 
                was feasible on industrial hardware. The assessment included cost-benefit analysis and implementation roadmap recommendations.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>6. Documentation & Recommendations</strong><br/>
                I compiled findings into a comprehensive feasibility report with technical details, test results, 
                recommendations, and a proposed implementation path for future development.

            <div class="project-details__desc">
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Key Technical Challenges Investigated</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Arc Light Interference:</strong> WAAM processes generate intense arc light that can overwhelm camera sensors 
                and wash out images. For this reason, a Cavitar camera was selected. 
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Path following noise:</strong> The camera path computed was noisy and required filtering to ensure stable tracking of the welding torch,
                along with smoothing and awareness of sudden direction changes or of jumps.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Geometric Complexity:</strong> WAAM produces 3D parts with complex geometries. 
                The more intricate the geometry, the more challenging it is to accurately track the welding torch 
                and keep the seam in the center of the FOV of the camera. So I developed a scoring system to evaluate tracking performance based on these factors.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Feasibility Assessment:</strong> The study concluded that vision system integration is 
                technically challenging both for the addition of two degrees of freedom to move the camera, 
                and for how hard it is to keep the seam at the center of the FOV for complex geometries.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Improving Factors:</strong> To ensure a good quality of the live inspection, 
                some changes were suggested for the camera setup, starting from an auxiliary arm to improve positioning flexibility.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Implementation Path:</strong> A phased approach was recommended, starting with offline image analysis before progressing 
                to real-time monitoring, with careful validation at each stage.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                <strong>Economic Viability:</strong> While initial implementation costs were significant, and the potential for improved quality control 
                and reduced scrap rates justified investment in vision system technology for high-value WAAM applications, 
                it was determined that further optimizations in the design of the system were needed to make real-time processing 
                feasible on industrial hardware.
