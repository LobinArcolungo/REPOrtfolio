          This 3D printer was my first foray into the world of 3D printing. 
          After a friend left it taking dust in a basement for a couple of years, 
          I decided to take it home and try to make it work again.

          I had to completely tear down the printer for repairs and upgrades. Starting with some good rust removal steps, swapping the bearings, and reassembling it with care.

          I modified the marlin firmware to improve print quality and add new features. This involved diving into the code, understanding the existing functionality, and making necessary adjustments. In detail, I had to tweak some extruder parameters and re-set the steps per millimeter for accurate movement.

          After all the upgrades, the printer was finally able to produce printed parts consistently. The most satisfying thing at last, was to use a lot of 3D printed parts to improve the prnter itself. For example in the picture can be seen that
          <ul class="carousel__slide-desc-list">
            <li class="carousel__slide-desc-list-item">Fan safety net was printed (in dark green)</li>

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc"> However some problems remained:
          <ul class="carousel__slide-desc-list">
            <li class="carousel__slide-desc-list-item">Bed calibration issues: I was able to print only in a small area of the plate, the rest was too warped to produce reliable printing</li>
            <li class="carousel__slide-desc-list-item">Constant supervision: I had to keep an eye on the prints to catch any failures early.</li>
            <li class="carousel__slide-desc-list-item">Temporary fixes: Paper clips and rubber bands were used to hold parts in place during printing</li>

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          After getting familiar with the FDM printer, I decided to explore resin printing. I acquired an Elegoo Saturn and started experimenting with water washable resins with the objective the least amount of toxic compounds to build my prototypes.

        <h4 class="carousel__slide-title">UV oven</h4>
        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          The UV oven is an essential tool for post-processing resin prints. It cures the resin quickly and evenly, ensuring a solid final product. I built my own UV oven using an old cardboard box and some UV LED strips. This setup allowed me to cure multiple prints at once and from every direction thanks to a transparent, hovering plate, saving time and improving the quality of my prototypes.

        <h4 class="carousel__slide-title">Bambulab A1 mini</h4>
        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          I eventually got fed up with all the additional work a resin printer requires. Cleaning, drying, curing. all with toxic materials was too much of a hassle for fast prototyping as i intended it.
          So i replaced my Elegoo witha  Bambulab A1 mini. Allowing myself to have top tier functionalities with minimum effort. this printer is Space efficient (small), fast, reliable, extremely precise and silent. It reduced the manual work after printing to a zero (beside support removal time) and calibration time to zero (it's automated and failproof). Basically solving all the problems I previously had with otre printers.
