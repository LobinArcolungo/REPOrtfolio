          If you were curious about what we did with all the beeswax that we salvaged from the <strong>beekeeping</strong> of the last 4 years, well, we turned it into beeswax bars! With each piece weighting 10 grams, it's very easy to use them for various purposes. For example, a waxed thread is much more resistant and durable, making it perfect for <strong>Needleworking</strong> and <strong>Leather crafting</strong>.

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          After collecting the beeswax, we melted it down and poured it into molds to create the bars. And for this purpouse, i designed and <strong>3D printed</strong> a custom mold that you can find it on makerworld <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/489777-tpu-wax-bar-mold#profileId-403082">here</a>.

        <h4 class="carousel__slide-title">Yes, but HOW DID YOU MELT IT?</h4>
        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          To melt the beeswax, we used a double boiler setup. This involves placing a heat-safe container with the beeswax inside a pot of simmering water. The gentle heat from the water melts the wax without risking burning it. It's important to monitor the temperature closely, as overheating can degrade the quality of the wax... Or at least that's the recomended way to do it. But I had to improvise a bit and build a makeshift double boiler using a candle, a tuna can and a metal case used for a face cream. And you can have a look at the contraption right here on the side.
