          A basket crafted from pine needles, we used pine needles from our local area and fastened them together with a juta string (a nylon string could have done the job but we wanted to go full natural). The result is a cute little tiny basket that smells like pines but it's also spiky if not handled with care.

          A leather case for an ipod nano 6 that has been embroidered with a cartoon inspired design. This project allowed me to combine my love for leather crafting with embroidery, resulting in a unique and functional piece for a gift to a person dear to me.

          This project was my first attempt at knitting. I started with a simple scarf pattern and learned the basics of knitting, including casting on, the knit stitch, and binding off. It was a rewarding experience that sparked my interest in exploring more complex knitting projects, even though the "scarf" came out more like a ribbon!

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          I wanted to produce a tridimensional bottle-shaped warming bag that could be heated in the microwave. This project involved sewing multiple layers of fabric together and filling them with cherry kernels, which retain heat well. The end result is a cozy and reusable warming bag that provides comfort during cold days or soothes sore muscles.

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          The technique of taxellating a shape and reproducing it in the physical word with several pieces sewn together is something that strongly connects with 3D modeling and something that I did from my elementary school, making paper crafts: drawn shapes that once cut and glued together fold and close up into complex models.
