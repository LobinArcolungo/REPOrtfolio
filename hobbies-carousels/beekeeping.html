        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          A good friend that helped us a lot with setting up the beeboxes one day called us saying that inside the house that he just bought, he found a hive inside a window.
          We went checking of course and we found a family of bees that despite being there since few weeks (you can see it from how white the hive is), had already built a huge beehive. With our surprise, we noticed that because of the amount of flowering ivy in the surroundings, it was for a good part full of honey.
          And so we managed to get some of what we called "Window honey".

          Since the tree types of that zone are mainly of three kinds, and they bloom in slightly different periods, we managed to differentiate two kind of honey: in this slide you can see, the fruity, sweet and almost cristal clear acacia honey.
