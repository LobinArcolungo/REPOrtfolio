          From the initial sketches to the final product, this headphone pouch was a labor of love and pain. I wanted to create something that was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The materials, as anticipated, were all recycled: the leather was sourced from leftover scraps, and the zipper was salvaged from an old trolley.

          Everything has a "back side". And even though I am extremely satisfied with the result, I recognize that my technique was at the earliest stage. The steps that I took were not always the smartest. I could have obtained the same result much faster by punching all the needle holes before, rather than doing them directly with the stitching needle.

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          This project involved creating a new cushion for my headphones. The original cushion had worn out, and I wanted to replace it with something new. I used eco-leather scraps from an old cosplay project, and a 3D (designed and) printed base to fit the replacement in the exact same place where the old cushion was, without damaging the clip mechanism of the worn out ones.

        <p class="carousel__slide-desc">
          This project involved creating a leather tortellino, a traditional Italian pasta shape. I wanted to experiment with leather as a medium for crafting unique and functional items. The process required careful planning and execution, from cutting the shapes to the stitching of them together. The result is a one-of-a-kind piece that showcases my skills and passion for The typical pasta from Bologna.

          But the tortellino didn't want to be just a cool shape to look at. In fact the inspiration for this "pouch" came to me while I was cooking with my girlfriend. What I thought is that if a simple shape, once filled and properly closed, could become a pasta type, why couldn't it become a small pouch to hold tiny items?
        </p>
        <p class="carousel__slide-desc"> 
          And so I added a zipper along the edges that allowed me to close it in a triangular shape. 
          I added an internal lining with a cotton cloth. And for the final touch, I sewed internally a couple of magnets that allow me to keep the pouch closed in the tortellino shape when not in use.

          Well if you swiped this far it means that you liked the idea of a leather tortellino pouch! Here you can see the internal locking stitch that I used to keep the pouch securely closed. But maybe I can reveal yet one more insight about this project.<br> Well you could have noticed the yellow stitches that go around the tortellino in an intricate pattern. These stitches were not just for decoration; they serve a functional purpose as well. In fact, after completing the headphone pouch project, I was left with many small pieces of leather and I didn't have a square piece big enough, so I had to improvise and use smaller scraps to create a square. The yellow stitches help to hold the smaller pieces together, creating a cohesive and visually appealing design. In total the stitched pieces are 11 different shapes.
