              Since the first time I saw a 3D printer I knew that I had to have one. 
              So starting from a rusty and unserviceable machine, I started learning, 
              unmounting, rebuilding, writing firmware, experimenting with materials, 
              temperatures and calibration. And finally I started modelling my own designs.
              Imagining something in your mind and having it in your hands before the sunset 
              it's sci-fi come true and this is something that gives me so much joy.
              With time, I upgraded my machine, from an old FDM prusa, to a resin Elegoo, 
              to an elegant and performant bambulab FDM.

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              During my bachelor degree, while the pandemic was preventing any social activity, a friend of mine and me retired on a house on the hills between Modena and Bologna and while studying for exams, we thought that it would have been cool to try to bring back to life an old activity that he used to do as a kid. So we put together a small starting amount of money, bought the missing equipment, and started this wonderful activity. 
              We restored beeboxes from scraps, crafted the looms, refreshed the wax sheets and recycled the wax from old unusable hives. We took care of the bees with treatments anti-parasites, breeded queens, and maybe one of the coolest thing: driving a van around the hills with boxes full of bees in the back.
              At the end we managed to produce a good quantity of honey, and finally, we said goodbye to them as I moved to Copenhagen and he moved to New Zaeland.
              In the slides below you can see some of the coolest things that happened and some results of which we are proud of.

              Leather crafting is another passion of mine. I love working with this material because of its durability and the beautiful results that can be achieved. It's true that leather is not the most sustainable material out there, but I only buy leather scraps from leather shops that sell the leftovers of what they already used and that they would otherwise throw away. Plus, I make sure to use every little piece to minimize waste.
              Below you can find a selection of my leather projects, showcasing different techniques and designs.

              What a funky name. But it's true that I really enjoy making things with needle and thread. The activities that I enjoy the most are for sure embroidery, leather crafting, sewing, tayloring, crocheting and recently knitting. But what I find fascinating is the use of strings as they are to create the most various things.
              You can see some of my work in the carousel below, hope it's interesting for you!

            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              Hiking and spending time in nature is one of my favorite pastimes. I love exploring new trails, breathing in the fresh air, and taking in the beautiful scenery. It's a great way to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and reconnect with the natural world.
              I often go hiking with friends or family, and we always have very good chats during the trail, enjoying the journey as much as the destination. Whether it's a challenging mountain trail or a leisurely walk through the woods, being in nature brings me a sense of peace and fulfillment. <br>
              I must also admit that since I bought mi dear tiny guitar, I always try to bring it with me. It's a great way to add some music to the experience and create lasting memories, and you can even see it appearing in the carousel below.

              Madboks is a no profit organization with the goal to reduce food waste by collecting donations of fruit and vegetables from supermarkets and distributing them to people that sign up to receive them. I admire and share their commitment to sustainability and community support. When I learned about their work, I immediately wanted to get involved and contribute in any way I could. So now I am one of their drivers and I help them in collection shifts twice per month.

              Since some years I started going regularly to social dances. 
              I really enjoy the music and the atmosphere, and it's a great way to meet new people.
              While the swing music is one of my favourite genres, the dancing styles that I most enjoy are Lindy Hop and Charleston.
              It's bouncy, active, and the community is welcoming and always happy to teach you something that you don't know.
              On the dance floor, it's easy to just have fun and vibe with the music.

              Since I was a kid I have been exposed to board games and role play games such as Dungeons&Dragons. And so here in Copenhagen I started building a small set of games of which I'm a big fan. Beside Dungeons&Dragons, of which I became a dungeon master, some of the titles are Vantage, The Binding of Isaac 4 Souls. 
              I also became a regular at the local board game café, where I met other people and discovered even more games to enjoy.

              How strange, an italian that likes to cook! Well, cooking is something that grew in me over the years. I started slowly, with easy recipes and as I moved out of my parents house, I felt more confident in doing experiments in the kitchen. I began trying with different ingredients and techniques, and now I enjoy preparing a wide variety of dishes, from traditional Italian meals to international cuisine.
              You can see below a small collection of my culinary creations: hand made Tortelloni (they are bigger than tortellini), mini fried skewers, passatelli, and handmade pizza that I personally prepare with the sourdough starter (that has as well a picture for himself).
